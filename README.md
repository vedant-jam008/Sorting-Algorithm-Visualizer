# SORTING ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
# This shows an interesting interactive animation of various Sorting Algorithms using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
# This enhances and makes "Sorting Algorithms" easier and more understandable

# BUBBLE SORT:
# Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

# QUICK SORT:
# QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 
# There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

# HEAP SORT:
# Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. 
# It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. 
# We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

# MERGE SORT:
# Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. 
# The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one

# INSERTION SORT:
# Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
# The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

# SELECTION SORT:
# The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

# The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

#    1) The subarray which is already sorted.
#    2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

# In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
